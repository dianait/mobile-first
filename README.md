# 🍏 Mobile first - Another future abandoned blog

👋 Welcome to **Mobile first**, a blog dedicated to sharing small nuggets of knowledge about the Swift programming language. Here, you'll find bite-sized articles that cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced techniques.

As a **iOS developer**, I've found that sometimes it's the small things that can make the biggest difference. That's why I have given another direction to this blog, to share the little tips and tricks that I've picked up that have helped me write better code.

So, grab a cup of coffee ☕️ and join me on this journey to discover the many flavors of Swift!

👷‍♀️ Build with Astro and deploy in Vercel.
